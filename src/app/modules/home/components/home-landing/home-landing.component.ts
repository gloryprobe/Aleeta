  What do you Mean by Social Media?
We frequently come across the term "social media" and are quite familiar with it, but what does it actually mean? Social media is a medium for communication and content creation, allowing users to share information, opinions, ideas, and much more. There are two main viewpoints about social media: one group believes it has a negative influence on people, while another group thinks it brings many positive outcomes. A comprehensive speech on social media should address both of these perspectives to provide a balanced view.


What are Some of the Most Widely used Social Media Platforms?
Let's look at what has made social media so popular and widely used in recent years. One major factor is the large number of active users, which greatly affects how much the platform grows, how attractive it is, and how people engage with it. This big user base helps make the platform successful and influential.


These applications serve as the building blocks for a large number of other applications as well. Currently, Facebook is the most popular social networking site on the planet, with more than 2.7 billion active monthly members worldwide. Each social media platform owned by the same company, including Facebook (the company's most popular forum), WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Instagram, has more than 1 billion monthly active users.


In addition, as the number of people who use social media continues to grow, it becomes increasingly clear how important social media has become in today's society.


Monograph on Social Media Use - An Introduction
People have always wanted to connect with others, but in the past, communication was limited to face-to-face interactions such as visiting homes or attending gatherings.


Today, social media has transformed how we connect. Due to busy lives and geographical distances, people now rely on technology to maintain relationships. Social networking sites and apps have revolutionised communication by allowing users to share information and ideas globally through interactive platforms. These sites, accessible from desktops, laptops, and mobile phones, are popular due to their features and ease of use.


Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter help us stay in touch with friends and acquaintances, while tools like YouTube, Instagram, and WhatsApp allow us to share photos and videos. Additionally, B2B social platforms and review sites enhance the shopping experience by facilitating discussions and offering collective buying deals.

While everyone was confined to their homes, unable to speak with anybody other than family and friends, it is critical to communicate with friends and family during Covid-19 to avoid being isolated. The outbreak resulted in social media being an essential tool for individuals to make entertaining videos and engage in social media challenges and activities, which helped keep people busy during these challenging circumstances.


As a result of the quick rise and extension of digital marketing, social media has played an essential part in this expansion. It's also a fantastic resource for finding information on a wide variety of topics. People may learn a great deal and stay up to date with the newest news worldwide by utilizing this. But there is always a drawback to every good that comes with it, no matter how beneficial.

Secondly, it's crucial to engage in offline activities. Spending time with family and friends in person can provide a more meaningful connection than online interactions.
